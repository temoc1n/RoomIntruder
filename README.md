# Room Intruder

### Why I did this?
<ul>
<li>Because I didn't had anything else to do and I love to play with machine learning algorithms.</li>
<br>
<li>Also because I don't live alone.</li>
</ul>

### What is this? 
<ul>
<li>A simple python script that uses face recognition in order to detect if anyone enters your room or not :) simple isn't it ? </li>
</ul>
